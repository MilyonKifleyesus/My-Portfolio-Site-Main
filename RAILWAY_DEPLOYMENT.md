# 🚀 Railway Full-Stack Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio website with both frontend and backend on Railway.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** - Your code is already there
2. **Railway Account** - Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. **MongoDB Atlas** - Your database is already set up

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Sign Up for Railway**

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Sign Up" and choose "Continue with GitHub"
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account

### **Step 2: Create New Project**

1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your repository: `MilyonKifleyesus/My-Portfolio-Site-Main`
4. Click "Deploy Now"

### **Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

1. In your Railway project dashboard, go to "Variables" tab
2. Add these environment variables:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://millikifleyesus:UDJRZCy8oZEnl20h@web.pdksjp4.mongodb.net/portfolio
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
PORT=5000
```

### **Step 4: Deploy and Wait**

1. Railway will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your React app
   - Start your Node.js server
   - Serve both frontend and backend

2. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

### **Step 5: Get Your Domain**

1. Once deployed, Railway will give you a URL like:
   `https://your-project-name.railway.app`

2. You can also set up a custom domain in the "Settings" tab

## 🌐 How It Works

### **Production Build Process:**
1. **Build Frontend**: `npm run build` creates `dist/` folder
2. **Start Server**: `npm run server` starts Express server
3. **Serve Static Files**: Server serves React build from `dist/`
4. **Handle API Routes**: All `/api/*` routes go to your backend
5. **React Routing**: All other routes serve `index.html` for SPA

### **File Structure in Production:**
```
your-project/
├── dist/           # Built React app
├── server.js       # Express backend
├── package.json    # Dependencies
└── railway.json    # Railway config
```

## 🔍 Testing Your Deployment

### **Frontend Routes:**
- `https://your-domain.railway.app/` - Home page
- `https://your-domain.railway.app/about` - About page
- `https://your-domain.railway.app/contact` - Contact page
- `https://your-domain.railway.app/admin` - Admin login

### **Backend API:**
- `https://your-domain.railway.app/api/health` - Health check
- `https://your-domain.railway.app/api/contact` - Contact form
- `https://your-domain.railway.app/api/admin/login` - Admin login

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Build Fails:**
   - Check Railway logs for errors
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

2. **MongoDB Connection Error:**
   - Check `MONGODB_URI` environment variable
   - Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows connections from Railway IPs
   - Verify database credentials

3. **Frontend Not Loading:**
   - Check if `dist/` folder was created during build
   - Verify `railway.json` configuration
   - Check Railway deployment logs

### **Useful Commands:**
```bash
# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Redeploy manually
railway up

# Check project status
railway status
```

## 💰 Pricing

- **Free Tier**: $5 credit monthly
- **Paid Plans**: Starting at $5/month
